            Technology has had a significant role in the evolution of the music industry over the years. Consider the progression from phonographs and analog 
            tape players to digital recording software and internet-based streaming services. Rapid advancements in digital technology over the last two decades 
            have had a profound impact on the music industry at all levels. As a result of technical improvements, the way individuals compose music has changed. 
            Composers can work from the comfort of their own homes to create cinematic compositions. Livestreamed performances enable musicians to perform in 
            front of fans all around the world. Songwriters can create albums and distribute them through digital distribution and streaming platforms without 
            ever securing or signing a record deal. Advances in digital technology have caused seismic disruptions in practically every sector of the music 
            industry. To some extent, early digital recording equipment and software simplified and reduced the cost of recording. Compact discs ostensibly 
            improved consumer audio quality while cutting manufacturing and distribution costs. Initially, digital technology fueled the music industry's
            expansion. After then, there was Napster. People were able to share and download music through the internet as the internet matured. Music 
            piracy no longer required dubbing tapes or creating CDs. Using file-sharing platforms, people could get practically any song they wanted for free. 
            As a result, the music industry's revenue has decreased. Paid digital distribution platforms, most notably iTunes, developed quickly after Napster 
            and revolutionized the commercialization of digital downloads. Streaming services like Spotify have drastically changed how people listen to music. 
            Despite the fact that these platforms now account for the vast bulk of music industry sales, revenues have yet to recover to pre-Napster levels.

          Throughout the decades, technology has greatly impacted the innovations for music. It has introduced devices that produce or modify sounds, effects 
          and volumes. These innovations have or are still changing the way we produce and perform music to this day. The music innovations that are most popular 
          and well known can be seen below:

          <p class="card-text text-white">A microphone is a device that converts airborne sound vibrations into electronic signals or records them on a recording medium.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text text-white">The amplification (or amp) is an electronic device or system that strengthens the weak electrical signal from a pickup on an electric 
          guitar, bass guitar, or acoustic guitar so that it can produce sound through one or more loudspeakers, which are usually housed in a wooden cabinet. 
          Amplifiers can also change the tone of an instrument by emphasizing or de-emphasizing specific frequencies, using equalizer controls that function 
          similarly to the bass and treble knobs on a home stereo, and by adding electronic effects; distortion (also known as "overdrive") and reverb are 
          common built-in features.</p>

          <p class="card-text text-white">A looper pedal is an electronic device that records a musical performance in real time and plays those recordings back. This 
          enables a musician to start overdubbing themselves in order to create a vast, polyphonic soundscape based on their own performances in the room. Loop pedals are 
          stompboxes that sit on the floor and are activated by the player's feet. Prior to the invention of loop pedals, players required large recording consoles 
          to capture and playback their performances with acceptable sound quality. However, some of today's compact loopers are no larger than any other guitar effects 
          pedal, while offering many minutes of recording time and nearly limitless overdubs.</p>

           I have thought of creating an app in the future called “Editor Music”that will be available on all devices. The purpose of “Editor Music” is to enhance the performance and 
           creativity of anyone who simply just uses the app. People can share and use anything that has been shared to the app. The app can help you recreate or create sounds that 
           you would like to use and can also be used to help you write lyrics for any music genre or anything that fits with the sound you chose or created. It will require access 
           to pictures, videos and microphone for the app to work properly. The app will listen to you when you are playing or creating a song then will ask how you want to improve it 
           or if you want to hear it played on a different instrument(s). For example if you are playing a “Fur Elise” on piano and you would like to hear a guitar version, “Editor 
           Music” will give you different types of guitar versions pre-recorded or some that were made by other users and you can use them later or modify them on your own using many 
           features used on all other music producing softwares such as autotune, synthesizers, bass and more. Hopefully, this app can become a reality in the future and be able to 
           create many hit songs.
